# ML_3Dtrack
This repository provides the codes used to extract features from microscopy videos (.m files) and perform feature engineering and model training via 
the sci-kit learn packages on jupyter. For size constraints, raw videos are not provided, instead the extracted datasets from the videos used for model
training have been given. The features to be extracted, and the parameters for particle tracking are system dependent, and therefore will require fine-tuning 
on the behalf of any potential user.
